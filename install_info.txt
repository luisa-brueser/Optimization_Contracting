1) Move to the project folder (the folder where "environment.yml" is located), open anaconda prompt and execute the following to create an environment called "<project name>":

	conda env create -p C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\envs\<project name> -f environment.yml

	e.g.: conda env create -p C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\envs\pv_optimizer_contracting -f environment.yml

	If successful, your terminal should show the following:

		Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done
		Solving environment: done
		Preparing transaction: done
		Verifying transaction: done
		Executing transaction: done
		Installing pip dependencies: 

		.. lots of dependencies installed ..

		#
		# To activate this environment, use
		#
		#     $ conda activate pv_optimizer_contracting
		#
		# To deactivate an active environment, use
		#
		#     $ conda deactivate


2) Activate the environment that you've created in the open anaconda prompt:

	conda activate pv_optimizer_contracting

	Terminal output should change from.. 

		(base) C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\envs\pv_optimizer_contracting>

	.. to:

		(pv_optimizer_contracting) C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\envs\pv_optimizer_contracting>

3) With your pv_optimizer_contracting-environment activated, execute the following in your project folder (the folder where "setup.py" is located), from the opened anaconda prompt:

	pip install -e .

	Terminal output:

	Obtaining file:///C:..../Code/pv_optimizer_contracting
	Installing collected packages: pv-supply-optimizer
		Running setup.py develop for pv-supply-optimizer
	Successfully installed pv-supply-optimizer
